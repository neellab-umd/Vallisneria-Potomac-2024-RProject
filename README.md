RProject with all R scripts needed for analyses and summaries of microsatellite diversity in the Potomac River

Microsatellite data needed for most analyses are stored in the allpotomac.microsatellite.data.csv ./data folder.  Many intermediate files created by different scripts have been written to the ./processed.data.  

Spatial data needed for cost distance analysis and mapping were too large to upload to github and are stored in a Dryad repository associated with this manuscript.  zip files called raw_rasters.zip, shapefiles.zip, and cost_surfaces.zip need to be downloaded and unzipped, and placed in the top level of the project directory.

The release of this project associated with the submitted manuscript (v0.1) is archived at Zenodo under DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.12774369.
